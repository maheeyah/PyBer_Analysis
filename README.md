# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project was to explore how the data differs by city type, which includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. And how those differences can be used to expand the PyBer business.

## Results:
The total rides for rural cities was 125 rides, suburban cities was 625 rides, and urban cities was 1625 rides. There were 78 rural drivers, 490 suburban drivers, and 2405 urban drivers. The total fares included $4327.93 for rural cities, $19356.33 for suburban cities, and $39854.38 for urban cities. The average fare per ride and driver was calculated using these results. The average fare per ride was $34.62 for rural cities, $30.97 for suburban cities, and $24.53 for urban cities. The average fare per driver was $55.49 for rural cities, $39.50 for suburban cities, $16.57 for urban cities. 

## Summary:
  To address the disparities among the city types, business recomgmendations would include hiring more rural and suburban drivers, increase total fare for suburban cities, and increase average fare for urban cities.
